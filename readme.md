#leo-cli
===================

leo-cli is a command line tool which can be used to translate words or phrases from several languages to german. It uses the open dictionary [dict.leo.org][]. I wrote this because visiting their website, choosing the language, typing the word and clicking the submit button required several too many steps. I am a lazy person.
